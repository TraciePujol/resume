            Dear Hiring Manager,
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to introduce myself and provide some context regarding my career journey.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Over the past years, I have dedicated my time to being a stay-at-home mom, which has been a rewarding experience. During this period, I 
            had the opportunity to reflect on my career aspirations and personal goals. It became clear to me that I have a strong passion for 
            technology, problem-solving, and a deep desire to pursue a career in the field of Information Systems and Decision Sciences.
        </p> 
        <p>
            To realize this dream, I have taken the proactive step of returning to school, where I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems 
            and Decision Sciences at LSU. This journey has allowed me to acquire valuable skills in areas such as web development, cloud computing, and 
            data analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills, enthusiasm, and dedication to a dynamic and forward-thinking team. My career break
             has provided me with a unique perspective, and I believe it has enhanced my adaptability, problem-solving abilities, and time management 
             skills. I am confident that I can contribute to the success of your organization through my dedication, hard work, and skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am eager to apply my knowledge and continue learning in a professional environment. I am confident that my background and determination 
            will make me a valuable candidate for any opportunity that aligns with my career goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for considering my application. Please find my resume attached for your reference. I look forward to the possibility of discussing 
            how my skills and experiences can contribute to your organization.
        
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Tracie Pujol</p>
